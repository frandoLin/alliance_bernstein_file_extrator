supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of February&nbsp;8, 2018, between AHFC and the Trustee (as so supplemented, the &#147;Indenture&#148;), and delivered against payment as contemplated herein, such Notes will be legally valid
and binding obligations of AHFC, enforceable against AHFC in accordance with their terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors&#146; rights generally
(including, without limitation, fraudulent conveyance laws), and by general principles of equity including, without limitation, concepts of materiality, reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing and the possible unavailability of specific
performance or injunctive relief, regardless of whether considered in a proceeding at law or in equity. This opinion is given as of the date hereof and is limited to the present laws of the State of California and the State of New York. In addition,
this opinion is subject to customary assumptions about the Trustee&#146;s authorization, execution and delivery of the Indenture and its authentication of the Notes and the enforceability of the Indenture with respect to the Trustee and other

investment in the notes and to determine whether the notes are a suitable investment for you. The notes may not be a suitable investment for you, including if you are unsophisticated with respect to the significant elements of the notes or financial
matters. Notes denominated or payable in a foreign currency are not an appropriate investment for investors who are unsophisticated with respect to foreign currency transactions. Indexed notes are not an appropriate investment for investors who are
unsophisticated with respect to the type of index or formula used to determine the amount payable. </I></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>You should carefully consider
the risk factors discussed below. In addition, certain factors that may adversely affect the business of AHFC are discussed in AHFC&#146;s most recent Annual Report on Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">10-K,</FONT> and such risk factors may be

secondary market does develop, it may not continue or it may not be sufficiently liquid to allow you to resell your notes if or when you want to or at a price that you consider acceptable. From time to time, the agents may make a market in the
notes, but any market making may be discontinued at any time. We do not intend to list the notes on any securities exchange. In evaluating the notes, you should assume that you will be holding the notes until their maturity. </P>

regard, notes issued at a substantial discount from their principal amount payable at maturity trade at prices that tend to fluctuate more in relation to general changes in interest rates than the prices for conventional interest-bearing notes with
comparable maturities. You should not purchase notes unless you understand and are able to bear the risk that the notes may not be easy to sell and that the value of the notes will fluctuate over time, perhaps significantly. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In addition, if your investment activities are subject to legal investment laws and regulations, you may not be able to invest in certain

except to the extent that AHFC is a creditor of the subsidiary and AHFC&#146;s claims are recognized, and to any preferred equity holders of that subsidiary. Therefore, the notes are effectively subordinated to all indebtedness and other obligations
of AHFC&#146;s consolidated subsidiaries and to any preferred equity holders of such subsidiaries. AHFC&#146;s subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligations to pay, or make funds available for the payment of, any amounts due on
the notes. The indenture governing the notes does not restrict AHFC and its subsidiaries from incurring additional indebtedness or other obligations or issuing preferred equity. The incurrence of additional indebtedness and other liabilities by AHFC
or its subsidiaries or issuance of any preferred equity by AHFC&#146;s subsidiaries could adversely affect AHFC&#146;s ability to pay obligations on the notes. As of June&nbsp;30, 2019, AHFC and its consolidated subsidiaries had approximately
$59.0&nbsp;billion of outstanding indebtedness and other liabilities, including current liabilities, of which approximately $16.8&nbsp;billion consisted of indebtedness and liabilities of its consolidated subsidiaries, and none of AHFC&#146;s

Prevailing interest rates at the time we redeem your notes would likely be lower than the rate borne by the notes as of the time they are redeemed. In such a case, you would not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at
an effective interest rate as high as the interest rate on the notes being redeemed. This may also be the case for any mandatory redemption of your notes. For this reason, an optional or mandatory redemption feature can affect the market value of
your notes. Our redemption right also may adversely impact your ability to sell your notes as the redemption date approaches. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Any credit ratings

such interest rate basis or interest rate formula or combination of rates as specified in the applicable pricing supplement, there will be significant risks not associated with conventional fixed rate notes. These risks include fluctuation of the
interest rates and the possibility that you will receive a lower amount of interest in the future as a result of such fluctuations. We have no control over various matters that are important in determining the existence, magnitude and longevity of
these risks, including economic, financial and political events. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Increased regulatory oversight and uncertainty relating to the LIBOR and EURIBOR

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">LIBOR is the subject of recent national and international regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms or actions by the British
Bankers&#146; Association (the &#147;BBA&#148;) in connection with the investigations into whether banks have been manipulating or attempting to manipulate LIBOR, may cause LIBOR to perform differently than in the past, or have other consequences
which cannot be predicted. For example, on July 27, 2017 and in a subsequent speech on July 12, 2018, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority confirmed that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021 (the
&#147;FCA Announcements&#148;). The FCA Announcements indicated that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021. It is not possible to predict whether, and to what extent, panel banks will continue to provide LIBOR
submissions to the administrator of LIBOR going forward. This may cause LIBOR to perform differently than it did in the past. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Separate
work-streams are also underway in Europe to reform EURIBOR using a hybrid methodology and to provide a fall-back by reference to a euro risk-free rate (based on a euro overnight risk-free rate as adjusted by a methodology to create a term rate). On
September&nbsp;13, 2018, the working group on euro risk-free rates recommended Euro Short-term Rate (&#147;&#128;STER&#148;) as the new risk free rate. &#128;STER is expected to be published by the European Central Bank by October 2019. In addition,
on January&nbsp;21, 2019, the euro risk free-rate working group published a set of guiding principles for fall-back provisions in new euro denominated cash products (including bonds). The guiding principles indicate, among other things, that
continuing to reference EURIBOR in relevant contracts may increase the risk to the euro area financial system. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any such changes, any establishment of alternative reference rates or any other
reforms to LIBOR and/or EURIBOR that may be enacted in the United Kingdom, in the United States or elsewhere. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes, alternative reference rates, the replacement or disappearance of LIBOR and/or
EURIBOR or other reforms may adversely affect the value of and the return on LIBOR- and EURIBOR-based securities, including the notes, which may be LIBOR- and/or EURIBOR-based. Although such notes will provide for alternative methods of calculating
the interest rate payable on such notes if LIBOR and/or EURIBOR are not reported, any of these alternative methods may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with the
interest rates and/or payments that would have been made on such notes if the LIBOR or EURIBOR rate, as applicable, was available in its current form. </P>

</B></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If you invest in notes indexed to one or more interest rates, currencies or composite currencies, including exchange rates and swap
indices between currencies or composite currencies, commodities or other indices or formulas, you will be subject to significant risks that are not associated with similar investments in a conventional fixed rate or floating rate debt security.
These risks include fluctuation of the indices or formulas and the possibility that you will receive a lower or no amount of principal, premium or interest, and at different times, than you expected. We have no control over a number of matters,
including economic, financial and political events, that are important in determining the existence, magnitude and longevity of these risks and their results. In addition, if an index or formula used to determine any amounts payable in respect of
the notes contains a multiplier or leverage factor, the effect of any change in the index or formula will be magnified. Although past experience is not necessarily indicative of what may occur in the future, in recent years, values of certain
indices and formulas have been highly volatile, and volatility in those and other indices and formulas may occur in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Investment in foreign

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If you invest in notes that are denominated and/or payable in a currency or basket of currencies other than U.S.&nbsp;dollars (foreign currency
notes), you will be subject to significant risks that are not associated with an investment in a debt security denominated and payable in U.S. dollars. These risks include the possibility of significant changes in rates of exchange between the
U.S.&nbsp;dollar and such currency and the possibility that either the United States or foreign governments will impose or modify foreign exchange controls. These risks generally depend on factors over which we have no control, such as economic and
political events and the supply of and demand for the relevant currencies. Moreover, if payments on your foreign currency notes are determined by reference to a formula containing a multiplier or leverage factor, the effect of any change in the
exchange rates between the applicable currencies will be magnified. In recent years, rates of exchange between the U.S.&nbsp;dollar and certain currencies have been highly volatile, and you should be aware that volatility may occur in the future.
Fluctuations in any particular exchange rate that have occurred in the past, however, are not necessarily indicative of fluctuations in the rate that may occur during the term of any note. Depreciation of your payment currency would result in a
decrease in the U.S. dollar equivalent yield of your foreign currency notes, in the U.S. dollar equivalent value of payments made on your foreign currency notes and, generally, in the U.S. dollar equivalent market value of your foreign currency
notes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Governmental exchange controls could affect exchange rates and the availability of your payment currency on a required payment

offered by AHFC and the extent to which these general provisions may apply to the notes will be described in a pricing supplement relating to the notes. If the terms of particular notes described in a pricing supplement are different from those

time. AHFC may without the consent of the holders of the notes, provide for the issuance of additional notes or other debt securities under the Indenture in addition to the notes offered by this prospectus supplement. As the notes constitute a

which less than $250,000 has been invested and 25%&nbsp;per annum on a simple interest basis for securities in which $250,000 or more has been invested. This limit may not apply to securities in which $2,500,000 or more has been invested. While AHFC
believes that New York law would be given effect by a state or federal court sitting outside of New York, state laws frequently regulate the amount of interest that may be charged to and paid by a borrower, including, in some cases, corporate

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>DTC.</I> DTC is a limited-purpose trust company organized under the New York Banking Law, a &#147;banking organization&#148; within the
meaning of the New York Banking Law, a member of the Federal Reserve System, a &#147;clearing corporation&#148; within the meaning of the New York Uniform Commercial Code, and a &#147;clearing agency&#148; registered pursuant to the provisions of
Section&nbsp;17A of the Exchange Act. DTC holds securities that its participating members, referred to as participants, deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the settlement among participants of securities transactions, such as transfers and
pledges, in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry changes in participants&#146; accounts, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct participants of DTC include securities brokers
and dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, certain other organizations and may include the agents. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust&nbsp;&amp; Clearing Corporation (&#147;DTCC&#148;). DTCC is the holding
company for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to DTC&#146;s system is also available
to others such as securities brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, referred to as indirect participants, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly. The rules applicable
to DTC and its participants are on file with the SEC. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Purchasers of notes in book-entry form under DTC&#146;s system must be made by or
through direct participants, which will receive a credit for those notes in book-entry form on DTC&#146;s records. The beneficial ownership interest of each actual purchaser of each note in book-entry form represented by a Global Note is, in turn,
to be recorded on the records of direct participants and indirect participants, including the records of Euroclear Bank SA/NV, (&#147;Euroclear&#148;), as operator of the Euroclear System and Clearstream Banking, S.A. (&#147;Clearstream&#148;).
Beneficial owners of notes in book-entry form will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase, but beneficial owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements
of their holdings, from the direct participants or indirect participants through which the beneficial owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in a Global Note representing notes in book-entry form are to be accomplished
by entries made on the books of participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial owners of a Global Note representing notes in book-entry form will not receive notes in certificated form representing their ownership interests therein,
except in the event that use of the book-entry system for such notes is discontinued. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">To facilitate subsequent transfers, all Global
Notes representing notes in book-entry form which are deposited with, or on behalf of, DTC are registered in the name of DTC&#146;s nominee, Cede&nbsp;&amp; Co. or such other name as requested by DTC. The deposit of Global Notes with, or on behalf
of, the depositary and their registration in the name of Cede&nbsp;&amp; Co. or another DTC nominee effect no change in beneficial ownership. DTC has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the Global Notes representing the notes in
book-entry form; DTC&#146;s records reflect only the identity of the direct participants to whose accounts such notes in book-entry form are credited, which may or may not be the beneficial owners. The participants will remain responsible for
keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Conveyance of notices and other communications by DTC to direct
participants, by direct participants to indirect participants, and by direct participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners, will be governed by arrangements among them, subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements as may be in
effect from time to time. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Neither DTC nor Cede&nbsp;&amp; Co. will consent or vote with respect to the Global Notes representing the
notes in book-entry form. Under its usual procedures, DTC mails an omnibus proxy to AHFC as soon as possible after the applicable record date. The omnibus proxy assigns Cede&nbsp;&amp; Co.&#146;s consenting or voting rights to those direct
participants, identified in a listing attached to the omnibus proxy, to whose accounts the notes in book-entry form are credited on the applicable record date. </P>

Notes representing the notes in book-entry form in immediately available funds to DTC. DTC&#146;s practice is to credit direct participants&#146; accounts on the applicable payment date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on its
records unless the depositary has reason to believe that it will not receive payment on the applicable payment date. Payments by participants to beneficial owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices, as is the case with
securities held for the accounts of customers in bearer form or registered in &#147;street name&#148;, and will be the responsibility of the applicable participant and not of DTC, the trustee or AHFC, subject to any statutory or regulatory
requirements as may be in effect from time to time. Payment of principal, premium, if any, and/or interest, if any, to DTC is the responsibility of AHFC and the trustee, disbursement of payments to direct participants will be the responsibility of
DTC, and disbursement of payments to the beneficial owners will be the responsibility of direct participants and indirect participants. </P>

in book-entry form of like tenor and terms are being redeemed, DTC&#146;s practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each direct participant in the issue to be redeemed. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A beneficial owner will give notice of any option to elect to have its notes in book-entry form repaid by AHFC, through its participant, to
the trustee, and will effect delivery of the applicable notes in book-entry form by causing the direct participant to transfer the participant&#146;s interest in the Global Note representing notes in book-entry form, on DTC&#146;s records, to the
trustee. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">DTC may discontinue providing its services as securities depositary with respect to the notes in book-entry form at any time by
giving reasonable notice to AHFC or the trustee. In the event that a successor securities depositary is not obtained, notes in certificated form are required to be printed and delivered. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">AHFC may decide to discontinue use of the system of book-entry transfers through DTC or a successor securities depositary. In that event,
notes in certificated form will be printed and delivered. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The laws of some states may require that certain purchasers of securities take
physical delivery of securities in definitive form. Such limits and such laws may impair the ability to own, transfer or pledge beneficial interests in Global Notes. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">So long as DTC, or its nominee, is the registered owner of a Global Note, DTC or its nominee, as the case may be, will be considered the sole
owner or holder of the notes represented by that Global Note for all purposes under the indenture. Except as provided below, beneficial owners of a Global Note will not be entitled to have the notes represented by a Global Note registered in their
names, will not receive or be entitled to receive physical delivery of the notes in definitive form and will not be considered the owners or holders thereof under the indenture. Accordingly, each person owning a beneficial interest in a Global Note
must rely on the procedures of DTC or any successor depositary and, if that person is not a participant, on the procedures of the participant through which that person owns its interest, to exercise any rights of a holder under the indenture. We
understand that under existing industry practices, if we request any action of holders or if an owner of a beneficial interest in a Global Note desires to give or take any action which a holder is entitled to give or take under the indenture, DTC
would authorize the participants holding the relevant beneficial interests to give or take the desired action, and the participants would authorize beneficial owners owning through the participants to give or take the desired action or would
otherwise act upon the instructions of beneficial owners. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Clearstream. </I>Clearstream is incorporated under the laws of Luxembourg as

Except in the case of stated interest payments, if you are a cash method taxpayer, you will not be required to recognize income with respect to the short-term notes prior to maturity, other than pursuant to a sale or exchange, as described below. If
you are an accrual method taxpayer, you will be required to include the discount in income as it accrues on a straight-line basis, unless you make an election to accrue the discount according to a constant yield method based on daily compounding. At
maturity of the short-term notes, any gain realized will be treated as ordinary income. Upon a sale, exchange or redemption of short-term notes, any gain you recognize should be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the discount accrued on a
straight-line basis (or, if elected, according to a constant yield method based on daily compounding) and short-term capital gain otherwise, and any loss you recognize will be treated as a capital loss. If you are a cash method taxpayer and you do
not make the election to include the discount in income on an accrual basis, you will be required to defer deductions for certain interest paid on indebtedness incurred to purchase or carry the short-term notes until you include the discount on the

reasonably be expected to measure contemporaneous variations in the cost of newly borrowed funds in the currency in which the floating rate notes are denominated. For example, the commercial paper rate, the LIBOR rate and the CMT rate will generally
be treated as qualified floating rates for notes denominated in U.S. dollars. In general, an &#147;objective rate&#148; is a rate that is not itself a qualified floating rate but that is determined using a single fixed formula that is based on
objective financial or economic information. A &#147;qualified inverse floating rate&#148; is any objective rate where such rate is equal to a fixed rate minus a qualified floating rate, as long as variations in the rate can reasonably be expected
to inversely reflect contemporaneous variations in the qualified floating rate. If floating rate notes provide for two or more qualified floating rates that can reasonably be expected to have approximately the same values throughout the term of the
notes, the qualified floating rates together constitute a single qualified floating rate. If interest on the notes is stated at a fixed rate for an initial period of one year or less followed by a variable rate that is either a qualified floating
rate or an objective rate for a subsequent period and the value of the variable rate on the issue date is intended to approximate the fixed rate, the fixed rate and the variable rate together constitute a single qualified floating rate or objective
rate. Two or more rates will be conclusively presumed to meet the requirements of the preceding sentences if the values of the applicable rates on the issue date are within <SUP STYLE="font-size:85%; vertical-align:top">1</SUP>/<SUB

supplement, it is expected, and this discussion assumes, that floating rate notes will qualify as &#147;variable rate debt instruments.&#148; Under the applicable Treasury regulations, special rules apply for purposes of determining whether a
variable rate debt instrument is issued with original issue discount. In general, a variable rate debt instrument may be required to be converted into an equivalent fixed rate debt instrument and then analyzed under the rules described above in
&#147;&#151;Original Issue Discount Notes&#151;General.&#148; You should consult your tax adviser with respect to the method of converting a variable rate debt instrument into a fixed rate debt instrument and the application of these rules. Other
than amounts treated as original issue discount, all stated interest on a variable rate debt instrument that is unconditionally payable in cash or in property (other than our debt instruments) will constitute qualified stated interest and will be
taxed as described above in &#147;&#151;Payments of Stated Interest.&#148; If floating rate notes do not qualify as &#147;variable rate debt instruments,&#148; then the floating rate notes will be treated as &#147;contingent payment debt

payment notes are listed on a national securities exchange or an interdealer quotation system sponsored by a national securities association, you generally would be permitted, but not required, to allocate such adjustment on a pro rata basis to the
daily portions of accrued interest (as described above) over the remaining term of the contingent payment notes. This pro rata allocation, however, would not be reasonable, and thus would not be permitted, to the extent that the allocation produces
a deemed yield on the contingent payment notes that is less than the applicable federal rate for the contingent payment notes as of the purchase date (determined as if the remaining term of the contingent payment notes were the term of the

the relevant projected payment is made (or if the projected payment becomes fixed more than six months prior to the due date for payment, when such payment becomes fixed). Any such positive or negative adjustment will increase or decrease,

and their application may depend on your particular U.S. federal income tax situation. For example, various elections are available under these rules, and whether you should make any of these elections may depend on your particular U.S. federal

dollar value of the foreign currency payment (determined based on a spot rate on the date the payment is received) regardless of whether the payment is in fact converted to U.S. dollars at that time, and this U.S. dollar value will be your tax basis
in the foreign currency. If you are a cash method holder and you receive a payment of qualified stated interest in U.S. dollars, you will be required to include the amount of this payment in income upon receipt. If you are a cash method holder, to

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If you use the accrual method of accounting for U.S. federal income tax purposes, you will
be required to include in income the U.S. dollar value of the amount of interest income (including original issue discount or market discount, but reduced by acquisition premium and amortizable bond premium to the extent applicable, each calculated
in the relevant foreign currency) that has accrued and is otherwise required to be taken into account with respect to foreign currency notes during an accrual period. The U.S. dollar value of the accrued income will be determined by translating the
income at an average rate of exchange for the accrual period or, with respect to an accrual period that spans two taxable years, at the average rate for the partial period within the taxable year. In addition to the interest income accrued as
described above, you will recognize ordinary income or loss (which will not be treated as interest income or expense) with respect to accrued interest income on the date the interest payment or proceeds from the sale, exchange or other disposition
attributable to accrued interest are actually received. The amount of ordinary income or loss recognized will equal the difference between the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency payment received (determined based on a spot rate on the date
the payment is received) in respect of the accrual period (or, where you receive U.S. dollars, the amount of the payment in respect of the accrual period) and the U.S. dollar value of interest income that has accrued during the accrual period (as
determined above). You may elect to translate interest income (including original issue discount) for an interest accrual period into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the last day of the interest accrual period (or, in the case of a partial accrual
period, the spot rate on the last day of the taxable year) or, if the date of receipt is within five business days of the last day of the interest accrual period, the spot rate on the date of receipt. If you make this election, you must apply it
consistently to all debt instruments from year to year and cannot change the election without the consent of the IRS. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">If an election to
amortize bond premium is made, amortizable bond premium taken into account on a current basis will reduce interest income in units of the relevant foreign currency. Foreign currency gain or loss (as defined below) is realized on amortized bond
premium with respect to any period by treating the bond premium amortized in the same period in the same manner as on the sale, exchange or retirement of the foreign currency notes (as discussed below). Any foreign currency gain or loss will be
ordinary income or loss as described below. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Tax Basis in Foreign Currency Notes</I>. Your tax basis in foreign currency notes, and the
amount of any subsequent adjustment to your tax basis, will be the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency amount paid for such foreign currency notes, or of the foreign currency amount of the adjustment, determined on the date of the purchase or
adjustment. If you purchase foreign currency notes with previously owned foreign currency, you will recognize ordinary income or loss in an amount equal to the difference, if any, between your tax basis in the foreign currency and the U.S. dollar
fair market value of the foreign currency notes on the date of purchase. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><I>Sale, Exchange or Retirement of Foreign Currency Notes</I>.
Gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange or retirement of foreign currency notes that is attributable to fluctuations in currency exchange rates (referred to as &#147;foreign currency gain or loss&#148;) will be ordinary income or loss which
will not be treated as interest income or expense. Foreign currency gain or loss generally will equal the difference between (i)&nbsp;the U.S. dollar value of the price (excluding any bond premium previously amortized) in the relevant foreign
currency that you received for such foreign currency notes, determined on the date the payment is received in exchange for the foreign currency notes or the foreign currency notes are disposed of, and (ii)&nbsp;the U.S. dollar value of the price you
paid for such notes (excluding any bond premium previously amortized) in the foreign currency of the foreign currency notes, determined on the date you acquired the foreign currency notes. Payments received attributable to accrued interest will be
treated in accordance with the rules applicable to payments of interest on foreign currency notes described above. The foreign currency gain or loss realized upon the sale, exchange or retirement of any foreign currency notes will be recognized only
to the extent of the total gain or loss realized by you on the sale, exchange or retirement of the foreign currency notes. Any gain or loss realized by you in excess of the foreign currency gain or loss will be capital gain or loss (except to the
extent of any accrued market discount, or, in the case of short-term notes, to the extent of any discount not previously included in your income). If you recognize a loss upon a sale or other disposition of foreign currency notes and such loss is
above certain thresholds, then you may be required to file a disclosure statement with the IRS. You should consult your tax adviser regarding this reporting obligation, as discussed under &#147;&#151;Disclosure Requirements&#148; below. </P>

on an established market, you will be required to translate units of foreign currency paid or received into U.S. dollars at the spot rate on the settlement date of the purchase or sale. Accordingly, no exchange gain or loss will result from currency
fluctuations between the trade date and the settlement of the purchase or sale. If you are an accrual method taxpayer, you may elect the same treatment for all purchases and sales of foreign currency obligations if such obligations are traded on an
established securities market. This election cannot be changed without the consent of the IRS. Any gain or loss realized by you on a sale or other disposition of foreign currency (including its exchange for U.S. dollars or its use to purchase

lists identifying investors in the transaction, and must furnish those records to the IRS upon demand. A transaction may be a &#147;reportable transaction&#148; based on any of several criteria. Whether an investment in the notes constitutes a
&#147;reportable transaction&#148; for you depends on your particular circumstances. You should consult your tax adviser concerning any possible disclosure obligation that you may have with respect to your investment in the notes and should be aware

enters into an agreement with the U.S. government to collect and provide to the U.S. tax authorities substantial information regarding certain U.S. account holders of such institution (which would include certain account holders that are foreign

pricing supplement, any note sold to an agent as principal will be purchased at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount minus a discount equal to the commission that would be paid on an agency sale of a note of identical maturity. Any agent
may sell any notes purchased by it as principal to investors at a fixed public offering price or at prevailing market prices, or at a related price, as determined by the agent. If AHFC sells notes directly to investors, no commission or discount

applicable pricing supplement), they may reduce that short position by purchasing notes in the open market. In general, purchases of notes for the purpose of stabilization or to reduce a short position could cause the price of notes to be higher
