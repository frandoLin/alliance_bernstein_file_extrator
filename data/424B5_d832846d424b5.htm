<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Bank is located in Austria and the members of the Board of Executive Directors and the Supervisory Board of the Bank, as well as the
experts and governmental officials and certain of the underwriters who may be named in the prospectus supplements, are residents of Austria or of other foreign countries, and all or a substantial portion of the assets of the Bank and certain other
persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible for investors to obtain jurisdiction over such persons in proceedings brought in courts in the United States, or to collect in the United States upon
judgments of United States courts against such persons, including judgments predicated upon civil liabilities under the United States Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;). There may be doubt as to the enforceability in
foreign courts, in original actions, of liabilities predicated upon the Securities Act and as to the enforceability in such courts of judgments of United States courts including judgments imposing liabilities predicated upon the Securities Act.
Judgments of United States courts will not be enforceable in Austria. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In the Fiscal Agency Agreement relating to each offering of
Guaranteed Debt Securities or Warrants, the Bank and Austria have expressly submitted to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the City of New York in actions arising out of or based upon such Guaranteed Debt Securities, the
guarantees of such securities by Austria (the &#147;Guarantees&#148;) or Warrants. In the case of Austria, this express submission does not extend to actions brought under United States securities laws. In addition to the specific submission to
jurisdiction referred to above, the Bank has, in the registration statement on Schedule B filed with the SEC of which this Prospectus forms a part, appointed an agent for service of process with respect to any actions arising out of or based upon
the offer and sale of the Guaranteed Debt Securities and Warrants in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States or any state thereof. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The United States Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976, which applies to Austria and may apply to the Bank, provides that foreign States
and their agencies or instrumentalities and their respective property are in varying degrees immune from the jurisdiction of courts in the United States. The Bank and Austria will expressly and irrevocably waive their immunity from suit and from
execution of a judgment in respect of actions arising out of or based on the Guaranteed Debt Securities, the Guarantees and the Warrants. These express waivers will not extend to actions brought under the United States securities laws, but the
United States Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 may afford a jurisdictional basis for such actions and preclude the claim of sovereign immunity in connection therewith. </P>

negotiated within the framework of the OECD, we will use the net proceeds from the sale of the Guaranteed Debt Securities and the Warrants, together with other borrowings we make, primarily to
finance export transactions, either directly or by repaying borrowings incurred to finance such transactions. However, since we pool the proceeds from the sale of Guaranteed Debt Securities and Warrants with the proceeds we receive from other
borrowings as part of our general annual cash flow planning process, the proceeds from any particular issuance of Guaranteed Debt Securities or Warrants cannot typically be attributed to any specific export financing transaction or repayment of
borrowings. We may also use the proceeds from these sales for temporary or interim investments or for any other purpose permitted by the Export Financing Guarantees Act or the &#147;Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits&#148;. We will
make additional borrowings, both domestic and external, of substantial amounts in connection with our financing of export transactions. The nature, amount and timing of such borrowings have not been determined and will be dependent on financial

was established in 1946 under the Austrian Stock Corporation Act (<I>Aktiengesetz</I>) to provide services outside routine commercial banking functions to the Austrian economy. The Bank&#146;s activities include the administration of export
guarantees (as agent of the Republic) and the financing of Austrian exports. Its registered and head office is located at Am Hof 4, <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">A-1010</FONT> Vienna, Austria. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In 1950 the Bank became involved in the financing and promotion of Austrian exports. Since the original adoption of the Export Promotion Act
in 1964, which was replaced on June&nbsp;1, 1981 by the Export Guarantees Act of 1981, and which has since been amended (the &#147;Export Guarantees Act&#148;), the Bank has acted as the sole agent of Austria for the administration of guarantees
issued by Austria under this Act covering commercial, political and foreign exchange risks in connection with Austrian exports. The Bank also provides medium- and long-term financing to banks and foreign importers for export transactions, the
repayment of which is guaranteed by Austria under the Export Guarantees Act. Substantially all borrowings by the Bank in connection with export loan financing are guaranteed either as to principal and interest, as to foreign exchange risk or as to
both by Austria under the Export Financing Guarantees Act. The Bank also engages in certain other financial activities including the organization and administration of domestic bond issues, in particular bond offerings by the Republic. CCP Austria
Abwicklungsstelle f&uuml;r B&ouml;rsengesch&auml;fte GmbH, or CCP.A, a joint venture between the Bank and the Vienna Stock Exchange, operates the clearing system of the Vienna Stock Exchange. Since September&nbsp;12, 2015, the Bank&#146;s subsidiary
OeKB CSD GmbH, or OeKB CSD, operates the business of the Austrian central securities depository (<I>Wertpapiersammelbank</I>) which before was operated by the Bank for five decades. It was transferred to OeKB CSD from the Bank due to regulatory
requirements. OeKB CSD is a company with limited liability and acts as central securities depository for Austria pursuant to the Austrian Securities Deposit Act. The Bank does not accept deposits from the general public or engage in general lending
or other commercial banking activities. In 2008, the Bank, on behalf of the Republic, established the Oesterreichische Entwicklungsbank AG to assist developing countries in establishing private industry. </P>

the primary offering, been offered to an undetermined number of people (&#147;public offer&#148;). This tax is in principle &#147;final&#148;, which means that no further taxation will be allowed on such capital gains and that they do not have to be

<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Under current United States federal income tax law, a backup withholding tax and information reporting requirements apply to certain payments
of principal, premium and interest made to, and to the proceeds of sale before maturity by, certain <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-corporate</FONT> United States persons. Certain exempt recipients (such as corporations) are not subject to
these information reporting requirements. Backup withholding will not apply to a holder who furnishes a correct taxpayer identification number or certificate of foreign status and makes any other required certification, or who is otherwise exempt
from backup withholding. United States persons who are required to establish their exempt status generally must file IRS Form <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">W-9</FONT> (&#147;Request for Taxpayer Identification Number and Certification&#148;). <FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">Non-United</FONT> States Holders generally will not be subject to United States information reporting or backup withholding. However, such holders may be required to provide certification of
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-United</FONT> States status in connection with payments received in the United States or through certain United States-related financial intermediaries. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Any amounts withheld from a payment to a holder under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a credit against such holder&#146;s
United States federal income tax liability and, to the extent in excess thereof, may entitle such holder to a refund, provided that the required information is timely furnished to the IRS. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Prospective purchasers of Guaranteed Debt Securities are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of the information

that own &#147;specified foreign financial assets&#148; that meet certain U.S. dollar value thresholds generally are required to file an information report with respect to such assets with their tax returns. The Guaranteed Debt Securities generally
will constitute specified foreign financial assets subject to these reporting requirements unless the Guaranteed Debt Securities are held in an account at financial institutions (in which case the account may be subject to these reporting
obligations if maintained at a foreign financial institution). United States Holders are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of these disclosure requirements to their ownership of the Guaranteed Debt Securities. </P>

exempt from or in deemed compliance with FATCA and (ii)&nbsp;any investor (unless otherwise exempt from FATCA) that does not provide information sufficient to determine whether the investor is a U.S. person or should otherwise be treated as holding
a &#147;United States account&#148; of the relevant paying FFI (a &#147;Recalcitrant Holder&#148;). The Bank is classified as an FFI. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The

&#147;grandfathering date&#148;, which is the date that is six months after the date on which final U.S.&nbsp;Treasury regulations defining the term &#147;foreign passthru payment&#148; are filed
with the Federal Register, or which are materially modified after the grandfathering date. If Guaranteed Debt Securities are issued on or before the grandfathering date, and additional Guaranteed Debt Securities of the same series are issued after

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The United States and many other jurisdictions have entered into intergovernmental agreements to facilitate the implementation of FATCA (each,
an &#147;IGA&#148;). Pursuant to FATCA and the &#147;Model 1&#148; and &#147;Model&nbsp;2&#148; IGAs released by the United States, an FFI in an IGA signatory country could be treated as a &#147;Reporting FI&#148; not subject to withholding under
FATCA on any payments it receives if it complies with the requirements of the relevant IGA. Further, in general an FFI in a Model 1 IGA jurisdiction (and in some cases, an FFI in a Model 2 IGA jurisdiction) would not be required to withhold under
FATCA or an IGA or any law implementing an IGA (any such withholding being &#147;FATCA Withholding&#148;) from payments it makes. The Model&nbsp;2 IGA leaves open the possibility that a Reporting FI might in the future be required to withhold as a
Participating FFI on foreign passthru payments and payments that it makes to Recalcitrant Holders. Each of the Model IGAs states that alternatives to achieve the policy objectives of foreign passthru payment withholding could be addressed in the
future. Under each Model IGA, a Reporting FI would still be required to report certain information in respect of its account holders and investors to its home government or to the IRS. The United States and Austria have entered into an agreement
(the &#147;U.S.-Austria IGA&#148;) based largely on the Model 2 IGA. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Bank has registered with the IRS and certified its status as a
&#147;Reporting Model 2 FFI&#148; pursuant to the U.S.-Austria IGA. It does not anticipate that it will be obliged to deduct any FATCA Withholding on payments it makes. There can be no assurance, however, that the Bank would in the future not be
required to deduct FATCA Withholding from payments it makes. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The Bank and financial institutions through which payments on the Guaranteed
Debt Securities are made may be required to withhold FATCA Withholding if (i)&nbsp;any FFI through or to which payment on such Guaranteed Debt Securities is made is not a Participating FFI, a Reporting FI, or otherwise exempt from or in deemed
compliance with FATCA or (ii)&nbsp;an investor is a Recalcitrant Holder. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">While the Guaranteed Debt Securities are in global form and held
within Euroclear and Clearstream, Luxembourg (together, the &#147;ICSDs&#148;) or DTC, it is expected that FATCA will not affect the amount of any payments made under, or in respect of, the Guaranteed Debt Securities by the Bank, the Republic, any
paying agent and the common depositary, given that each of the entities in the payment chain between the Bank and the participants in the ICSDs or DTC is either a U.S. entity not subject to FATCA Withholding or a major financial institution whose
business is dependent on compliance with FATCA and that any alternative approach introduced under an IGA will be unlikely to affect the Guaranteed Debt Securities. The documentation expressly contemplates the possibility that the Guaranteed Debt
Securities may go into definitive form and therefore that they may be taken out of the ICSDs or DTC. If this were to happen, then a <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">non-FATCA</FONT> compliant holder could be subject to FATCA Withholding. However,
definitive Guaranteed Debt Securities will only be issued in remote circumstances. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">FATCA is particularly complex and certain aspects of
its application are uncertain at this time. The above description is based in part on regulations, official guidance and IGAs, all of which are subject to change or may be implemented in a materially different form. Prospective investors should
consult their tax advisors on how these rules may apply to the Bank and to payments they may receive in connection with the Guaranteed Debt Securities. </P>
