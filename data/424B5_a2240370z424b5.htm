MiFID II product governance / Professional investors and ECPs only target market  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Solely for the purposes of each manufacturer's product approval process, the target market assessment in respect of the notes has led to the
conclusion that: (i)&nbsp;the target market for the notes is eligible counterparties and professional clients only, each as defined in Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, "MiFID II"); and
(ii)&nbsp;all channels for distribution of the notes to eligible counterparties and professional clients are appropriate. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the notes (a
"distributor") should take into consideration the manufacturers' target market assessment; however, a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in
respect of the notes (by either adopting or refining the manufacturers' target market assessment) and determining appropriate distribution channels. </FONT></P>

PRIIPs Regulation / Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notes are not intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any
retail investor in the European Economic Area (the "EEA"). For these purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i)&nbsp;a retail client as defined in point (11)&nbsp;of
Article&nbsp;4(1) of MiFID II; or (ii)&nbsp;a customer within the meaning of Directive (EU) 2016/97 (the "Insurance Distribution Directive"), where that customer would not qualify as a
professional client as defined in point (10)&nbsp;of Article&nbsp;4(1) of MiFID II. Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (the "PRIIPs Regulation") for
offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the notes or otherwise making them available to any
retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPs Regulation. </FONT></P>

Forward-Looking Information  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus may contain "forward-looking information" ("FLI") as such term is defined under
applicable Canadian securities laws. FLI is disclosure regarding possible events, conditions or results of operations that is based on assumptions about future economic conditions and courses of
action and includes future-oriented financial information ("FOFI") and information presented in the form of a "financial outlook" with respect to prospective results of operations, financial position
or cash flows that is presented either as a forecast or a projection. FOFI is FLI about prospective results of operations, financial position or cash flows, based on assumptions about future economic
conditions and courses of action, and presented in the format of a historical balance sheet, income statement or cash flow statement. Similarly, a "financial outlook" is FLI about prospective results
of operations, financial position or cash flows that is based on assumptions about future economic conditions and courses of action that is not presented in the format of a historical balance sheet,
income statement or cash flow statement. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Canadian
investors are advised that FLI is subject to a variety of risks, uncertainties and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from expectations as
expressed or implied within this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus. FLI reflects current expectations with respect to future events and is not a guarantee of future performance.
Any FLI that may be included or incorporated by reference within this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, including any FOFI or "financial outlook", is presented solely for the
purpose of conveying our current anticipated expectations and may not be appropriate for any other purposes. Canadian investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any FLI that may be
included or incorporated by reference within this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus and are advised that we are not obligated to provide recipients of this prospectus supplement
and the accompanying prospectus with information updating any such FLI during any period that we are not a "reporting issuer" in any province or territory of Canada, other than as may be required
under applicable securities laws and/or as agreed to in contract. This offering is being made by a non-Canadian issuer using disclosure documents prepared in accordance with non-Canadian securities
laws. Prospective purchasers should be aware that these requirements may differ significantly from those in Canada. Any FLI included or incorporated by reference within this prospectus supplement and
accompanying prospectus may not be accompanied by the disclosure and explanations that would be required of a Canadian issuer under Canadian securities laws. </FONT></P>

Exposure to U.K. political developments, including the ongoing negotiations between the U.K. and EU, could
have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On June&nbsp;23, 2016, the UK held a referendum on EU membership in which the majority voted in favor of leaving the EU. Following two
previous extensions of the originally scheduled exit date, the EU has agreed to a further extension until January&nbsp;31, 2020, unless the UK and the EU are able to ratify a withdrawal agreement
prior to that date. If the UK and EU ratify the withdrawal agreement by January&nbsp;31, 2020, a transition period has been agreed which will last until December&nbsp;31, 2020. During this period,
most EU rules and regulations will continue to apply to the UK and negotiations in relation to a free trade agreement will commence. The transition period may be extended once by up to two years.
While continuing to discuss the Article&nbsp;50 withdrawal agreement and political declaration, the UK Government has commenced preparations for a "hard" Brexit (or "no-deal" Brexit) to minimize the
risks for firms and businesses associated with an exit with no transitional period. This has included publishing draft secondary legislation under powers provided in the European Union (Withdrawal)
Act 2018 to ensure that there is a functioning statute book after any exit with a transitional agreement. There remains a great deal of uncertainty about the UK's exit and its future relationship with
the European Union and with regard to the UK's future trading relationship with the rest of the world. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
outcome of Brexit remains uncertain; however, the UK's exit from the European Union without an agreement remains a possibility and the consensus position is that it would have a
negative impact on the UK economy and its growth prospects. While it is difficult to predict the long-term effects of the UK's imminent exit from the European Union, in the short term the situation is
one of economic and political uncertainty. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
are subject to significant regulation and supervision by the European Union. Although legislation has already been passed transferring EU standards to UK standards, uncertainty
persists as to the legal and regulatory environments in which we and other subsidiaries of Santander UK Group Holdings&nbsp;plc will operate in the UK when that country is no longer a member of the
European Union, and the framework in which cross-border banking business will take place after Brexit. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
the operational level, we, Santander UK Group Holdings&nbsp;plc's UK subsidiaries and other financial institutions may no longer be able to rely on the European cross-border
framework for financial services and it is not clear what the alternative regime after Brexit will be. This uncertainty and the measures taken as a result of it, as well as the new or amended rules
could have a significant impact on our operations, profitability and business. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These
UK political developments, together with other changes in the structure and policies of government, could lead to greater market volatility and changes in the tax, monetary and
regulatory landscape in which we operate and could have material adverse effects on our access to capital and liquidity under acceptable conditions and, more generally, on our business, financial
position and operating results. </FONT></P>

We are subject to regulatory capital and leverage requirements that could limit our operations, and changes
to these requirements may further limit and adversely affect our operations, financial condition and prospects  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please refer to the risk factor "We are subject to regulatory capital and leverage requirements that could limit our operations, and changes to
these requirements may further limit and adversely affect our operations, financial condition and prospects" on pages&nbsp;231-232 of the Annual Report on Form&nbsp;20-F. On November&nbsp;26,
2016, the European Commission published legislative proposals for amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive IV ("CRD IV"), the Single Resolution Mechanism Regulation ("SRM Regulation") and the
EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive ("BRRD") (together, the "CRD V Package"). The European Parliament adopted the final texts of the CRD V Package on April&nbsp;16, 2019, which were
subsequently adopted by the Council of the European Union on May&nbsp;14, 2019. The CRD V Package entered into force on June&nbsp;27, 2019. The amendments to the CRD&nbsp;IV Regulation will
apply from June&nbsp;28, 2021 (with some exceptions). EU Member States will be expected to adopt and publish the measures necessary to comply with the amendments to the CRD IV Directive by
December&nbsp;28, 2020, and to apply these measures from December&nbsp;29, 2020 (with some exceptions). EU Member States are expected to adopt and publish the measures necessary to comply with the
amendments to the BRRD by December&nbsp;28, 2020, and to apply these measures from the same date (with some exceptions). The Financial Services (Implementation of Legislation) Bill, which received
its first reading in the House of Lords in November 2018, would, subject to the detailed provisions set out in the Bill, permit HM Treasury to implement the CRD V Package by way of regulations, with
any adjustments that HM Treasury considers appropriate. The Bill was due to have its report stage and third reading on March&nbsp;4, 2019, but this was postponed. The Bill has made no further
progress and will have to be reintroduced from scratch, as it failed to complete its passage through Parliament in the last parliamentary season. As a result, the potential impact on us of the CRD V
Package is currently uncertain. These requirements could materially increase our cost of doing business, including that we may have to issue increased debt to meet the requirements. The amendments to
the SRM Regulation will apply from December&nbsp;28, 2020. </FONT></P>

Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "trustee") (as successor to Law Debenture Trust Company of New York pursuant to an Agreement of Resignation, Appointment and Acceptance dated
June&nbsp;2, 2017 among the issuer, the trustee and Law Debenture Trust Company of New York), as supplemented and amended by the first supplemental indenture entered into on November&nbsp;3, 2017
and by a sixth supplemental indenture expected to be entered into on January&nbsp;13, 2020, between the issuer and the trustee (as supplemented and amended, the "indenture"). The notes will each be

Interest Payments  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The notes will bear interest at a rate of 2.100% per year. The notes will accrue interest from and including January&nbsp;13, 2020, or from
and including the most recent date to which interest has been paid (or provided for), to but excluding the next date upon which interest is required to be paid. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest
will be payable on the notes twice a year, on January&nbsp;13 and July&nbsp;13, and on the maturity date of the notes, commencing July&nbsp;13, 2020 to the person in whose
name the notes are registered at the close of business on the fifteenth calendar day, whether or not a business day, that precedes the applicable date on which interest will be paid. Interest on the
notes will be paid on the basis of a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months. For the notes, "business day" means any day, other than a Saturday or Sunday, that is neither a legal holiday nor
a day on which banking institutions in the City of New York or London, England are authorized or required by law, regulation or executive order to close. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stated interest on the notes will be treated as qualified stated interest for U.S. federal income tax purposes. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S.
holders that use an accrual method of accounting for tax purposes ("accrual method holders") generally are required to include certain amounts in income no later than the time such
amounts are reflected on certain financial statements (the "book/tax conformity rule"). The application of the book/tax conformity rule thus may require the accrual of income earlier than would be the
case under the general tax rules described in the accompanying prospectus. It is not entirely clear to what types of income the book/tax conformity rule applies, or, in some cases, how the rule is to
be applied if it is applicable. However, recently released proposed regulations generally would exclude, among other items, original issue discount and market discount (in either case, whether or not
de minimis) from the applicability of the book/tax conformity rule. Although the proposed regulations generally will not be effective until taxable years beginning after the date on which they are
issued in final form, taxpayers generally are permitted to elect to rely on their provisions currently. Accrual method holders should consult with their tax advisors regarding the potential
applicability of the book/tax conformity rule to their particular situation. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2><I> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foreign Financial Asset Reporting.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain U.S. holders that own "specified foreign financial assets" with an aggregate value in excess
of $50,000 on
the last day of the taxable year or $75,000 at any time during the taxable year are generally required to file an information statement along with their tax returns, currently on Form&nbsp;8938,
with respect to such assets. "Specified foreign financial assets" include any financial accounts held at a non-U.S. financial institution, as well as securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer (which may
include Notes issued in certificated form) that are not held in accounts maintained by financial institutions. Higher reporting thresholds apply to certain individuals living abroad and to certain
married individuals. Regulations extend this reporting requirement to certain entities that are treated as formed or availed of to hold direct or indirect interests in specified foreign financial
assets based on certain objective criteria. U.S. holders who fail to report the required information could be subject to substantial penalties. In addition, the statute of limitations for assessment
of tax would be suspended, in whole or part. Prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors concerning the application of these rules to their investment in the Notes, including the
application of the rules to their particular circumstances. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For United Kingdom tax purposes, so long as the notes are and continue to be admitted to trading on a "recognised stock exchange" within the
meaning of section&nbsp;1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007, payment of interest on the notes may be made without withholding or deduction for or on account of United Kingdom income tax. The New York
Stock Exchange is currently a "recognised stock exchange" within the meaning of section&nbsp;1005 of the Income Tax Act 2007. For a discussion of

pricing agreement and underwriting agreement provide that the underwriters are severally obligated to purchase all of the notes if any are purchased. The pricing agreement and
underwriting agreement also provide that if an underwriter defaults, the purchase commitments of non-defaulting underwriters may be increased or the offering of notes may be terminated. The
underwriters may offer and sell the notes through one or more of their respective affiliates or selling agents. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
underwriters propose to offer the notes initially at the price to public listed on the cover page of this prospectus supplement and to other broker-dealers at the applicable price to
public less a selling concession of 0.125% of the principal amount per note. The underwriters and other broker-dealers may allow discounts of 0.075% of the principal amount per note on sales to other
broker-dealers. After the initial public offering, the underwriters may change the price to public, concessions and discounts to
broker-dealers. The offering of the notes by the underwriters is subject to receipt and acceptance and subject to the underwriters' right to reject any order in whole or in part. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
estimate that our expenses (which consist of, among other fees, SEC registration fees, legal fees and expenses, accounting fees and expenses and printing expenses) for this offering,
excluding the underwriting discount, will be approximately $536,466 and will be payable by us. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
notes are a new issue of securities with no established trading market. One or more of the underwriters intends to make a secondary market for the notes. However, they are not
obligated to do so and may discontinue making a secondary market for the notes at any time without notice. No assurance can be given as to how liquid the trading market for the notes will be. We
intend to list the notes on the New York Stock Exchange or another recognized securities exchange; however, there can be no assurance that the notes will be so listed by the time the notes are
delivered to purchasers or that the listing will be granted. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We

stabilizing transactions, syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of the notes or preventing or retarding a
decline in the market price of the notes. As a result, the price of the notes may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
is no assurance that the underwriters will undertake stabilization action. Such stabilizing, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time and, if begun, must be brought to an end

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, in the ordinary course of their business activities, the underwriters and their affiliates may make or hold a broad array of investments and actively trade debt and equity
securities (or related derivative securities) and financial instruments (including bank loans) for their own account and for the accounts of their customers. Such investments and securities activities
may involve securities and/or instruments of ours or our affiliates. Certain of the underwriters or their affiliates that have a lending relationship with us routinely hedge their credit exposure to
us consistent with their customary risk management policies. Typically, such underwriters and their affiliates would hedge such exposure by entering into transactions which consist of either the
purchase of credit default swaps or the creation of short positions in our securities, including potentially the notes offered hereby. Any such short positions could adversely affect future trading
prices of notes offered hereby. The underwriters and their affiliates may also make investment recommendations and/or publish or express independent research views in respect of such securities or
financial instruments and may hold, or recommend to clients that they acquire, long and/or short positions in such securities and instruments. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
expect that delivery of the notes will be made against payment therefor on or about January&nbsp;13, 2020, which is the fifth business day in the City of New York after the date of
this prospectus supplement. Under Rule&nbsp;15c6-1 of the Exchange Act, trades in the secondary market generally are required to settle in two New York business days, unless the parties to any such
trade expressly agree otherwise. Accordingly, purchasers who wish to trade the notes on any date prior to two business days before delivery will be required, by virtue of the fact that the notes
initially will not settle in T+2, to specify an alternative settlement cycle at the time of such trade to prevent a failed settlement and should consult their own adviser. </FONT></P>

Market-Making Resales by Affiliates  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prospectus supplement together with the accompanying prospectus and your confirmation of sale may also be used by Santander Investment
Securities&nbsp;Inc. ("SIS") in connection with offers and sales of the notes in market-making transactions at negotiated prices related to prevailing market prices at the time of sale. In a
market-making transaction, SIS may resell a security it acquires from other holders of notes after the original offering and sale of the notes. Resales of this kind may occur in the open market or may
be privately negotiated, at prevailing market prices at the time of resale or at related or negotiated prices. In these transactions, SIS may act as principal or agent, including as agent for the
counterparty in a transaction in which SIS acts as principal, or as agent for both counterparties in a transaction in which SIS does not act as principal. SIS may receive compensation in the form of
discounts and commissions, including from both counterparties in some cases. Other of our affiliates may also engage in transactions of this kind and may use this prospectus supplement and the
accompanying prospectus for this purpose. Neither SIS, nor any other of our affiliates have an obligation to make a market in the notes and, if commenced, may discontinue any market-making activities
at any time without notice, in their sole discretion. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
SIS may be required to discontinue its market-making activities during periods when we are (or when SIS is) seeking to sell certain of our securities or when SIS, such as by
means of its affiliation with us, learns of material non-public information relating to us. SIS would not be able to recommence its market-making activities until such sale has been completed or such
information has become publicly available. It is not possible to forecast the impact, if any, that any such discontinuance may have on the market for the notes. Although other broker-dealers may make
a market in the notes from time to time, there can be no assurance that any other broker-dealer will do so at any time when SIS discontinues its market-making activities. In addition, any such
broker-dealer that is engaged in market-making activities may thereafter discontinue such activities at any time at its sole discretion. </FONT></P>

Prohibition of Sales to EEA Retail Investors  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the applicable prospectus supplement includes a section entitled "Prohibition of sales to EEA retail investors," the securities are not
intended to be offered, sold or otherwise made available to and should not be offered, sold or otherwise made available to any retail investor in the European Economic Area (the "EEA"). For these
purposes, a retail investor means a person who is one (or more) of: (i)&nbsp;a retail client as defined in point (11)&nbsp;of Article&nbsp;4(1) of Directive 2014/65/EU (as amended, "MiFID II");
(ii)&nbsp;a customer within the meaning of Directive 2002/92/EC (as amended or superseded, the "Insurance Mediation Directive"), where that customer would not qualify as a professional client as
defined in point (10)&nbsp;of Article&nbsp;4(1) of MiFID II; or (iii)&nbsp;not a qualified investor as defined in Directive 2003/71/EC (as amended or superseded, the "Prospectus Directive").
Consequently no key information document required by Regulation (EU) No 1286/2014 (as amended, the "PRIIPs Regulation") for offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to
retail investors in the EEA has been prepared and therefore offering or selling the securities or otherwise making them available to any retail investor in the EEA may be unlawful under the PRIIPS
Regulation. The
expression "Prospectus Directive" means Directive 2003/71/EC (and amendments thereto, including Directive 2010/73/EU), and includes any relevant implementing measure in any Member State. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
document is for distribution only to persons who (i)&nbsp;have professional experience in matters relating to investments and who fall within Article&nbsp;19(5) of the Financial
Services and Markets Act&nbsp;2000 (Financial Promotion) Order 2005/1529 (as amended, the "Financial Promotion Order"), (ii)&nbsp;are persons falling within Article&nbsp;49(2)(a) to
(d)&nbsp;("high net worth companies, unincorporated associations etc.") of the Financial Promotion Order, (iii)&nbsp;are outside the United Kingdom ("UK"), or (iv)&nbsp;are persons to whom an
invitation or inducement to engage in investment activity (within the meaning of section&nbsp;21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act&nbsp;2000) in connection with the issue or sale of any
securities may otherwise lawfully be communicated or caused to be communicated (all such persons together being referred to as "relevant persons"). This document is directed only at relevant persons
and must not be acted on or relied on by persons who are not relevant persons. Any investment or investment activity to which this document relates is available only to relevant persons and will be
engaged in only with relevant persons. This document has been prepared on the basis that any offer of securities in any Member State of the EEA will be made pursuant to an exemption under the
Prospectus Directive from the requirement to produce a prospectus for offers of securities. Accordingly any person making or intending to make an offer in that Member State of securities which are the
subject of an offering contemplated in this document as completed by final terms in relation to the offer of those securities may only do so in circumstances in which no obligation arises for us or
any of the underwriters to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article&nbsp;3 of the Prospectus Directive or supplement a prospectus pursuant to Article&nbsp;16 of the Prospectus Directive, in each
case, in relation to such offer. Neither we nor any of the underwriters have authorized, nor do we or any of the underwriters authorize, the making of any offer of the securities in circumstances in
which an obligation arises for us or the underwriters to publish a prospectus for such offer. Neither we nor the underwriters have authorized, nor do we authorize, the making of any offer of
securities through any financial intermediary, other than offers made by the underwriters, which constitute the final placement of the securities contemplated in this document. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where
the applicable prospectus supplement includes a section entitled "MiFID II product governance," it will outline the target market assessment in respect of the securities and the
appropriate channels for distribution. Any person subsequently offering, selling or recommending the securities (a "distributor") should take into consideration the target market assessment; however,
a distributor subject to MiFID II is responsible for undertaking its own target market assessment in respect of the securities (by either adopting or refining the target market assessment made in
respect of such securities by any manufacturer) and determining appropriate distribution channels. For the </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This prospectus is part of a registration statement that we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") utilizing the
"shelf registration process." Under the shelf registration process, we may sell the debt securities described in this prospectus in one or more offerings. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There
are certain restrictions on the distribution of this prospectus as set out in "Plan of Distribution (Conflicts of Interest)." </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with any issue of securities through this prospectus, a stabilizing manager or any person acting for it may over-allot or effect transactions with a view to supporting the
market price of such securities at a level higher than that which might otherwise prevail for a limited period after the issue date. However, there may be no obligation on the stabilizing manager or
any agent of it to do this. Such stabilizing, if commenced, may be discontinued at any time, and must be brought to an end after a limited period. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
prospectus provides you with a general description of the debt securities we may offer. Each time we sell securities, we will provide prospective investors with a prospectus
supplement that will contain specific information about the terms of the debt securities. The prospectus supplement may also add to or update or change information contained in this prospectus. You
should read both this prospectus and any accompanying prospectus supplement together with the additional information described under the heading "Where You Can Obtain More Information." </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales. Most of our directors and executive officers (and certain experts named in
this prospectus or in documents incorporated herein by reference) are residents of the United Kingdom or countries other than the United States, and a substantial portion of our assets and the assets
of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, you should note that it may be difficult or impossible to serve legal process on us, our directors, officers and managers, and to
force them to appear in a U.S. court. Our legal counsel in England, Slaughter and May, has advised us that there is doubt as to the enforceability in England, in original actions or in actions to
enforce judgments of U.S. courts, of liabilities founded in U.S. Federal or State securities laws. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
have consented to service of process in the Borough of Manhattan, the City of New York, for claims based on the documents underlying the particular debt securities that we will issue,
which include the related indenture, deposit and custody agreements, the terms of the debt securities themselves and the related global debt securities. </FONT></P>

The relevant UK resolution authority could exercise the UK bail-in power which could impose losses on an
investment in the debt securities.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On October&nbsp;1, 2013, the UK Government published amendments to the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill. The amendments introduced,
among other things, a national "bail-in" power, which forms part of the existing special resolution regime under the Banking Act. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Directive
2014/59/EU establishing a framework for the recovery and resolution of credit institutions and investment firms as amended from time to time (the "BRRD") entered into force on
July&nbsp;2, 2014. The BRRD contains similar resolution tools and powers to the Banking Act, including a bail-in power which gives resolution authorities the power to write down the claims of
unsecured creditors of a failing institution and to convert unsecured debt claims to equity (subject to certain parameters). The UK Government decided to implement the BRRD bail-in power from
January&nbsp;1, 2015 with the final phase of the rules implemented on 1&nbsp;January 2016. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
UK bail-in power is an additional power available to the UK resolution authorities under the special resolution regime provided for in the Banking Act, to enable them to recapitalize
a failed institution by allocating losses to such institutions' shareholders and unsecured creditors subject to the rights of such creditors to be compensated under a bail-in compensation order. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Such
an order would be based on the principle that such creditors should receive no less favorable treatment than they would have received, had the bank entered into insolvency

(in whole or in part) certain liabilities (including the debt securities) or modify the terms of certain contracts (including the debt securities) for the purposes of reducing or deferring
the liabilities of a relevant institution under resolution and the power to convert certain liabilities (including the debt securities) into shares (or other instruments of ownership) of the relevant
institution. The conditions for use of the UK bail-in power are generally that (i)&nbsp;the regulator determines the relevant institution is failing or likely to fail, (ii)&nbsp;it is not
reasonably likely that any other action can be taken to avoid such relevant institution's failure, and (iii)&nbsp;the relevant UK resolution authority determines that it is in the public interest to
exercise the bail-in powers, including liabilities to the extent they are secured. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According
to the Banking Act, as well as similar principles in the BRRD, the relevant UK resolution authority should have regard to the insolvency treatment principles when exercising
the UK bail-in power (including in respect of the debt securities). The insolvency treatment principles are that (i)&nbsp;the exercise of the UK bail-in power should be consistent with treating all
liabilities of the bank in accordance with the priority that they would enjoy upon liquidation and (ii)&nbsp;any creditors who would have equal priority upon liquidation should bear losses on an
equal footing with each other. Adding to these principles, the Banks and Building Societies (Priorities on Insolvency) Order 2018, which implements in the UK Directive (EU) 2017/1299 (the Insolvency
Hierarchy Directive), came into force in the UK on 19&nbsp;December 2018. The UK Treasury may, by order, specify further matters or principles to which the relevant UK resolution authority must have
regard when exercising the UK bail-in power. These principles may be specified in addition to, or instead of, the insolvency treatment principles. If the relevant UK resolution authority departs from
the insolvency treatment principles when exercising the UK bail-in power, it must report to the Chancellor of the Exchequer stating the reasons for its departure. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
debt securities are subject to the provisions of the UK bail-in power and consequently may be subject to a partial or full write-down, modification or conversion to equity. Holders
of the debt securities (including each holder of a beneficial interest in the debt securities) may lose all of their investment in the debt securities, including the principal amount plus any accrued
interest, if the UK bail-in power is acted upon and any remaining outstanding securities or securities into which the debt securities are converted may be of little value at the time of conversion and
thereafter. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moreover,
to the extent the UK bail-in power is exercised pursuant to the Banking Act, we do not expect any securities issued upon conversion of the debt securities to meet the listing
requirements of any securities exchange. Any securities received by holders of the debt securities upon conversion of the debt securities (whether debt or equity) likely will not be listed for at
least an extended period of time, if at all, or may be on the verge of being delisted by the relevant exchange. Additionally, there may be limited, if any, disclosure with respect to the business,
operations or financial statements of the issuer of any securities issued upon conversion of the debt securities, or the disclosure with respect to any existing issuer may not be current to reflect
changes in the business, operations or financial statements as a result of the exercise of the UK bail-in power. As a result, there may not be an active market for any securities held after the
exercise of the UK bail-in power. </FONT></P>

The circumstances under which the relevant UK resolution authority would exercise its UK bail-in power are
uncertain, which may affect the value of the debt securities.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is considerable uncertainty regarding the specific factors beyond the goals of addressing banking crises pre-emptively and minimizing
taxpayers' exposure to losses (for example, by utilizing resolution tools and writing down relevant capital instruments before the injection of public funds into a financial institution) which the
relevant UK resolution authority would consider in deciding whether to exercise the UK bail-in power with respect to the relevant financial institution and/or securities, such as the debt securities,
issued by that institution. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While
pre-conditions have been proposed for the exercise of the UK bail-in power under the Banking Act (as described in the preceding paragraphs), there is no certainty as to how the
relevant UK resolution authority will exercise in practice any bail-in power with respect to a financial institution and/or securities, such as the debt securities, issued by that institution. The UK
Treasury may by order specify matters or principles to which the relevant UK resolution authority must have regard in exercising its bail-in powers including insolvency treatment principles or
alternative principles. Notwithstanding any such secondary legislation, the relevant UK resolution authority is likely to have considerable discretion as to how it exercises the UK bail-in power. As
there may be many factors, including factors outside of our control or not directly related to us, which could result in such a determination, holders of the debt securities may not be able to refer
to publicly available criteria in order to anticipate a potential exercise of any such UK bail-in power. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly,
the threat of bail-in may affect trading behavior, including prices and volatility, and, as a result, the debt securities are not necessarily expected to follow the trading
behavior associated with other types of securities. </FONT></P>

resolution authority.  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the Banking Act, holders of securities will have a right to be compensated under a bail-in compensation order which is based on the
principle that such investors should receive no less favorable treatment than they would have received had the bank entered into insolvency immediately before the coming into effect of the UK bail-in
power. A similar principle is set out in the BRRD. There is some uncertainty as to what other protections will be available to holders of securities (including the debt securities) subject to the UK
bail-in power and to the broader resolution powers of the relevant UK resolution authority. Accordingly, the holders of the debt securities (including each holder of a beneficial interest in the debt
securities) have limited rights to challenge any decision of the relevant UK resolution authority to exercise the UK bail-in power. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The special resolution regime in the Banking Act provides relevant UK resolution authorities with a variety of other powers, in addition to the
UK bail-in power, for dealing with UK banks. See "Shareholder information&#151;Risk factors&#151;The Banking Act may adversely affect our business" on page&nbsp;229 of our 2018 Annual

jurisdiction"), unless such deduction or withholding is required by fiscal or other laws, regulations and directives. If at any time a taxing jurisdiction requires us to make such deduction or
withholding, we will pay additional amounts with respect to the principal of, interest and any other payments on, the debt securities ("Additional Amounts") that are necessary in order that the net
amounts paid to the holders of those debt securities, after the deduction or withholding, shall equal the amounts which would have been payable on that series of debt securities if the deduction or

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The United Kingdom (or any political subdivision thereof or therein having the power to tax) may require us to withhold or deduct amounts from
payments of principal or interest on the debt securities, for taxes or other governmental charges. If such a withholding or deduction is required, we may be required to pay additional amounts such
that the net amount paid to holders of the debt securities, after such deduction or withholding, equals the amount that would have been payable had no such withholding or deduction been required. </FONT></P>

enough cash to make interest, principal and any other payments on the debt securities on their various due dates. In addition, on the date of such deposit, we must not be in default. For purposes of
this no-default test, a default would include an event of default that has occurred and not been cured, as described under "&#151;Events of Default and Default; Limitation of

and any holder of debt securities, by its acquisition of the debt securities, each holder of debt securities (including each holder of a beneficial interest in the debt securities) acknowledges,
accepts, agrees to be bound by and consents to: (a)&nbsp;the effect of the exercise of the UK bail-in power (as defined below) by the relevant UK resolution authority (as defined below) whether or
not imposed with prior notice, that may include and result in any of the following, or some combination thereof: (i)&nbsp;the reduction of all, or a portion, of the Amounts Due (as defined below);
(ii)&nbsp;the conversion of all, or a portion, of the Amounts Due on the debt securities into shares, other securities or other obligations of the Issuer or another person (and the issue to or
conferral on the holders of debt securities of such shares, securities or obligations), including by means of an amendment, modification or variation of the terms of the debt securities;
(iii)&nbsp;the cancellation of the debt securities; (iv)&nbsp;the amendment or alteration of the maturity of the debt securities or amendment of the amount of interest payable on the debt
securities, or the date on which the interest becomes payable, including by suspending payment for a temporary period; and (b)&nbsp;the variation of the terms of the debt securities, if necessary,
to give effect to the exercise of the UK bail-in power by the relevant UK resolution authority. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For
these purposes, "Amounts Due" are the principal amount of, and accrued but unpaid interest, including any Additional Amounts due on, the debt securities. References to principal and

authority. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
used in this prospectus, the "UK bail-in power" is any write-down, conversion, transfer, modification, or suspension power existing from time to time under, and exercised in
compliance with, any laws, regulations, rules or requirements in effect in the United Kingdom, relating to the transposition of the BRRD, including but not limited to the Banking Act, and the
instruments, rules and standards created thereunder, pursuant to which: (i)&nbsp;any obligation of a regulated entity (as defined below) (or other affiliate of such regulated entity) can be reduced,
cancelled, modified, or converted into shares, other securities, or other obligations of such regulated entity or any other person (or suspended for a temporary period); and (ii)&nbsp;any right in a
contract governing an obligation of a regulated entity may be deemed to have been exercised. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
reference to a "regulated entity" is to any BRRD undertaking as such term is defined under the PRA Rulebook promulgated by the United Kingdom Prudential Regulation Authority, as

a cancellation or deemed cancellation of the principal or interest (in each case, in whole or in part), nor the exercise of the UK bail-in power by the relevant UK resolution authority with respect to

will not impose any duties upon the trustee whatsoever with respect to the exercise of any UK bail-in power by the relevant UK resolution authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, following the
completion of the exercise of the UK bail-in power by the relevant UK resolution authority, the debt securities remain outstanding (for example, if the exercise of the UK bail-in power results in only
a partial write-down of the principal of the debt securities), then the trustee's duties under the indenture shall remain applicable with respect to the debt securities following such completion to

bail-in power by the relevant UK authority, so long as any debt securities remain outstanding, there will at all times be a trustee for the debt securities in accordance with the indenture, and the
resignation and/or removal of the trustee and the appointment of a successor trustee will continue to be governed by the indenture, including to the extent no additional supplemental indenture or

exercise of any UK bail-in power with respect to such debt securities as it may be imposed, without any further action or direction on the part of such holder or the trustee. In addition, the exercise
of the UK bail-in power may require that interests in the debt securities be held and/or other actions implementing the UK bail-in power to be taken, as the case may be, through clearing systems,

outstanding principal amount (or at such other repayment amount as may be specified in or determined in accordance with the relevant prospectus supplement) together with accrued interest, if any, as
provided in the prospectus supplement. The trustee may at its discretion and without further notice institute such proceedings as it may think suitable, against us to enforce payment. Subject to the

shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the trustee with respect to
the series. However, this direction must not be in conflict with any rule of law or the indenture, and must not be unjustly prejudicial to the holder(s) of any debt securities of that series not

Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations  </B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following is a summary of certain U.S. federal income tax considerations that may be relevant to a holder of a debt security that is a
citizen or resident of the United States or a domestic corporation or that otherwise is subject to U.S. federal income taxation on a net income basis in respect of the debt security (a "U.S. holder").
This summary is based on laws, regulations, rulings and decisions now in effect, all of which are subject to change. This summary deals only with U.S. holders that will hold debt securities as capital
assets, and does not address tax considerations applicable to investors that may be subject to special tax rules, such as banks, tax-exempt entities, insurance companies, dealers in securities or
currencies, traders in securities electing to mark to market, persons that will hold debt securities as a position in a "straddle" or conversion transaction, or as part of a "synthetic security" or
other integrated financial transaction or persons that have a "functional currency" other than the U.S. dollar. In addition, this summary does not address any aspects of the Medicare contribution tax
on net investment income. Any special U.S. federal income tax considerations relevant to a particular issue of debt securities will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplement. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Investors
should consult their own tax advisors in determining the tax consequences to them of holding debt securities, including the application to their particular situation of the
U.S. federal income tax considerations discussed below, as well as the application of state, local, foreign or other tax laws. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S.
holders that use an accrual method of accounting for tax purposes ("accrual method holders") generally are required to include certain amounts in income no later than the time such
amounts are reflected on certain financial statements (the "book/tax conformity rule"). The application of the book/tax conformity rule thus may require the accrual of income earlier than would be the
case under the general tax rules described below. It is not clear to what types of income the book/tax conformity rule applies, or, in some cases, how the rule is to be applied if it is applicable.
Accrual method holders should consult with their tax advisors regarding the potential applicability of the book/tax conformity rule to their particular situation. </FONT></P>

Payments of Interest  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payments of "qualified stated interest" (as defined below under "Original Issue Discount") on a debt security will be taxable to a U.S. holder
as ordinary income at the time that such payments are accrued or are received (in accordance with the U.S. holder's method of tax accounting). </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payments
of interest and additional amounts on debt securities will be treated as foreign source income for the purposes of calculating a U.S. holder's foreign tax credit limitation. The
limitation on foreign taxes eligible for the U.S. foreign tax credit is calculated separately with respect to specific classes of income. The rules relating to foreign tax credits and the timing
thereof are complex. U.S. holders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the availability of a foreign tax credit under their particular circumstances. </FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A U.S. holder's tax basis in a debt security generally will equal the cost of such debt security to such holder, increased by any amounts
includible in income by the holder as original issue discount and market discount and reduced by any amortized premium (each as described below) and any payments other than payments of qualified
stated interest made on such debt security. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon
the sale, exchange or retirement of a debt security, a U.S. holder generally will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale, exchange or
retirement (less any accrued qualified stated interest, which will be taxable as such) and the U.S. holder's tax basis in such debt security. </FONT></P>

Original Issue Discount  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Issuer issues debt securities at a discount from their stated redemption price at maturity (as defined below), and the discount is equal
to or greater than the product of one-fourth of one percent (0.25%) of the stated redemption price at maturity of the debt securities multiplied by the number of full years to their maturity, the debt
securities will be "OID debt securities." U.S. holders of OID debt securities generally will be subject to the special tax accounting rules for obligations issued with original issue discount ("OID")
provided by the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and certain regulations promulgated thereunder (the "OID Regulations"). U.S. holders of such debt securities should be aware that, as
described in greater detail below, they generally must include OID in ordinary gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes as it accrues, in advance of the receipt of cash attributable to that
income. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
general, each U.S. holder of an OID debt security, whether such holder uses the cash or the accrual method of tax accounting, will be required to include in ordinary gross income the
sum of the "daily portions" of OID on the debt security for all days during the taxable year that the U.S. holder owns the debt security. The daily portions of OID on an OID debt security are
determined by allocating to each day in any accrual period a ratable portion of the OID allocable to that accrual period. Accrual periods may be any length and may vary in length over the term of an
OID debt security, provided that no accrual period is longer than one year and each scheduled payment of principal or interest occurs on either the final day or the first day of an accrual period. In
the case of an initial holder, the amount of OID on an OID debt security allocable to each accrual period is determined by (a)&nbsp;multiplying the "adjusted issue price" (as defined below) of the
OID debt security at the beginning of the accrual period by the yield to maturity of such OID debt security (appropriately adjusted to reflect the length of the accrual period) and
(b)&nbsp;subtracting from that product the amount (if any) of qualified stated interest (as defined below) allocable to that accrual period. The yield to maturity of a debt security is the discount
rate that causes the present value of all payments on the debt security as of its original issue date to equal the issue price of such debt security. The "adjusted issue price" of an OID debt security
at the beginning of any accrual period will generally be the sum of its issue price and the amount of OID allocable to all prior accrual periods, reduced by the amount of all payments other than
payments of qualified stated interest (if any) made with respect to such debt security in all prior accrual periods. The term "qualified stated interest" generally means stated interest that is
unconditionally payable in cash or property (other than debt instruments of the issuer) at least annually during the entire term of an OID debt security at a single fixed rate of interest or, subject
to certain conditions, based on one or more interest indices. In the case of an OID debt security that bears interest at a floating rate, both the "yield to maturity" and "qualified stated interest"
will generally be determined for these purposes as though the OID debt security will bear interest in all periods at a fixed rate generally equal to the rate that would be applicable to the interest
payments on the debt security on its date of issue or, in the case of certain floating rate debt securities, the rate that reflects the yield that is reasonably expected for the debt security.
(Additional rules may apply if interest on a floating rate debt security is based on more than one interest index.) As a result of this "constant yield" method of including OID in income, the amounts
includible in income by a U.S. holder in respect of an OID debt security denominated in U.S. dollars generally are lesser in the early years and greater in the later years than the amounts that would
be includible on a straight-line basis. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A U.S. holder generally may make an irrevocable election to include in its income its entire return on a debt security (i.e.,&nbsp;the excess of all remaining
payments to be received on the debt security, including payments of qualified stated interest, over the amount paid by such U.S. holder for such debt security) under the constant-yield method
described above. For debt securities purchased at a premium or bearing market discount in the hands of the U.S. holder, the U.S. holder making such election will also be deemed to have made the
election (discussed below in "&#151;Premium and Market Discount") to amortize premium or to accrue market discount in income currently on a constant-yield basis. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
subsequent U.S. holder of an OID debt security that purchases the debt security at a cost less than its remaining redemption amount (as defined below), or an initial U.S. holder that
purchases an OID debt security at a price other than the debt security's issue price, also generally will be required to include in gross income the daily portions of OID, calculated as described
above. However, if the U.S. holder acquires the OID debt security at a price greater than its adjusted issue price, such holder is required to reduce its periodic inclusions of OID income to reflect
the premium paid over the adjusted issue price. The "remaining redemption amount" for a debt security is the total of all future payments to be made on the debt security other than payments of
qualified stated interest. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Floating
rate debt securities generally will be treated as "variable rate debt instruments" under the OID Regulations. Accordingly, the stated interest on a floating rate debt security
generally will be treated as "qualified stated interest" and such a debt security will not have OID solely as a result of the fact that it provides for interest at a variable rate. If a floating rate
debt security does not qualify as a "variable rate debt instrument," such debt security will be subject to special rules (the "Contingent Payment Regulations") that govern the tax treatment of debt
obligations that provide for contingent payments ("Contingent Debt Obligations"). A detailed description of the tax considerations relevant to U.S. holders of any such debt securities will be provided
in the applicable prospectus supplement. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain
of the debt securities may be subject to special redemption features, as indicated in the applicable prospectus supplement. Debt securities containing such features, in
particular OID debt securities, may be subject to special rules that differ from the general rules discussed above. Purchasers of debt securities with such features should carefully examine the
applicable prospectus supplement and should consult their own tax advisors with respect to such debt securities since the tax consequences with respect to such features, and especially with respect to
OID, will depend, in part, on the particular terms of the purchased debt securities. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a debt security provides for a scheduled accrual period that is longer than one year (for example, as a result of a long initial period on a debt security with interest that is
generally paid on an annual basis), then stated interest on the debt security will not qualify as "qualified stated interest" under the applicable Treasury Regulations. As a result, the debt security
would be an OID debt security. In that event, among other things, cash-method U.S. holders will be required to accrue stated interest on the debt security under the rules for OID described above, and
all U.S. holders will be required to accrue OID that would otherwise fall under the </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>de minimis</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> threshold. </FONT></P>

Premium and Market Discount  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A U.S. holder of a debt security that purchases the debt security at a cost greater than its remaining redemption amount (as defined in the
fourth preceding paragraph) will be considered to have purchased the debt security at a premium, and may elect to amortize such premium (as an offset to interest income), using a constant-yield
method, over the remaining term of the debt security. Such election, once made, generally applies to all bonds held or subsequently acquired by the U.S. holder on or after the first taxable year to
which the election applies and may not be revoked without the consent of the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS"). A U.S. holder that elects to amortize such premium must reduce its tax basis in a debt
security by the amount of the premium amortized during its holding period. OID debt securities purchased at a premium will not be subject to the OID rules described </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>above.
With respect to a U.S. holder that does not elect to amortize bond premium, the amount of bond premium will be included in the U.S. holder's tax basis when the debt security matures or is
disposed of by the U.S. holder. Therefore, a U.S. holder that does not elect to amortize such premium and that holds the debt security to maturity generally will be required to treat the premium as
capital loss when the debt security matures. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
a U.S. holder of a debt security purchases the debt security at a price that is lower than its remaining redemption amount, or in the case of an OID debt security, its adjusted issue
price, by at least 0.25% of its remaining redemption amount multiplied by the number of remaining whole years to maturity, the debt security will be considered to have "market discount" in the hands
of such U.S. holder. In such case, gain realized by the U.S. holder on the disposition of the debt security generally will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of the market discount that
accrued on the debt security while held by such U.S. holder. In addition, the U.S. holder could be required to defer the deduction of a portion of the interest paid on any indebtedness incurred or
maintained to purchase or carry the debt security. In general terms, market discount on a debt security will be treated as accruing ratably over the term of such debt security, or, at the election of
the holder, under a constant-yield method. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A
U.S. holder may elect to include market discount in income on a current basis as it accrues (on either a ratable or constant-yield basis), in lieu of treating a portion of any gain
realized on a sale of a debt security as ordinary income. If a U.S. holder elects to include market discount on a current basis, the interest deduction deferral rule described above will not apply.
Any such election, if made, applies to all market discount bonds acquired by the taxpayer on or after the first day of the first taxable year to which such election applies and is revocable only with
the consent of the IRS. </FONT></P>

Short-Term Debt Securities  </I></B></FONT></P>

</UL>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The rules set forth above will also generally apply to debt securities having maturities of not more than one year ("short-term debt
securities"), but with certain modifications. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First,
the OID Regulations treat </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>none</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> of the interest on a short-term debt security as qualified stated interest. Thus, all short-term
debt securities will be OID debt securities. OID will be treated as accruing on a short-term debt security ratably, or at the election of a U.S. holder, under a constant yield method. </FONT></P>


<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second,
a U.S. holder of a short-term debt security that uses the cash method of tax accounting and is not a bank, securities dealer, regulated investment company or common trust fund,
and does not identify the short-term debt security as part of a hedging transaction, will generally not be required to include OID in income on a current basis. Such a U.S. holder may not be allowed
to deduct all of the interest paid or accrued on any indebtedness incurred or maintained to purchase or carry such debt security until the maturity of the debt security or its earlier disposition in a
taxable transaction. In addition, such a U.S. holder will be required to treat any gain realized on a sale, exchange or retirement of the debt security as ordinary income to the extent such gain does
not exceed the OID accrued with respect to the debt security during the period the U.S. holder held the debt security. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a cash-basis U.S. holder of a short-term debt
security may elect to accrue OID into income on a current basis or to accrue the "acquisition discount" on the debt security under the rules described below. If the U.S. holder elects to accrue OID or
acquisition discount, the limitation on the deductibility of interest described above will not apply. </FONT></P>

U.S. holder using the accrual method of tax accounting and certain cash-basis U.S. holders (including banks, securities dealers, regulated investment companies and common trust funds)

non-U.S. financial institution, as well as securities issued by a non-U.S. issuer (which may include Notes issued in certificated form) that are not held in accounts maintained by financial
institutions. Higher reporting thresholds apply to certain individuals living abroad and to certain married individuals. Regulations extend this reporting requirement to certain entities that are
treated as formed or availed of to hold direct or indirect interests in specified foreign financial assets based on certain objective criteria. U.S. holders who fail to report the required information
could be subject to substantial penalties. In addition, the statute of limitations for assessment of tax would be suspended, in whole or part. Prospective investors should consult their own tax

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of FATCA and related intergovernmental agreements, holders of the debt securities may be required to provide information and tax

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
United Kingdom has entered into an intergovernmental agreement with the United States relating to FATCA (the "US&#151;UK IGA"). Pursuant to the US&#151;UK IGA and
applicable UK regulations implementing the US&#151;UK IGA, we may be required to comply with certain reporting requirements. Holders of the debt securities therefore may be required to provide
information and tax documentation regarding their identities, as well as that of their direct and indirect owners, and this information may be reported to the Commissioners for Her Majesty's
Revenue&nbsp;&amp; Customs ("HMRC"), and ultimately, the IRS. We intend to comply with any applicable reporting requirements pursuant to the US&#151;UK IGA and applicable UK regulations
implementing the US&#151;UK IGA. Assuming the debt securities are treated as debt for U.S. federal income tax purposes and are not materially modified after the applicable "grandfathering
date," payments on the debt securities will not be subject to FATCA withholding. The applicable "grandfathering date" is the date that is six months after the date on which final United States
Treasury regulations defining the term "foreign passthru payment" are filed with the Federal Register. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Issuer may sell all or part of the debt securities from time to time on terms determined at the time such debt securities are offered for
sale to or through underwriters or through selling agents. The Issuer may also sell such debt securities directly to other purchasers. The names of any such underwriters or selling agents in
connection with the offer and sale of any series of debt securities will be set forth in the accompanying prospectus supplement relating thereto. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
distribution of the debt securities may be effected from time to time in one or more transactions at a fixed price or prices, which may be changed, or at market prices prevailing at
the time of sale, at prices related to such prevailing market prices or at negotiated prices. If the Issuer uses underwriters in the sale of such debt securities, they will acquire those debt
securities for their own account and such debt securities may be resold from time to time in one or more transactions. Such debt securities may be offered to the public either through underwriting
syndicates represented by managing underwriters or underwriters without a syndicate. Unless otherwise set forth in the prospectus supplement, the underwriters' obligations to purchase such debt
securities will be subject to certain conditions precedent. The underwriters will be obligated to purchase all of such debt securities if any of such debt securities are purchased. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with the sale of debt securities, the underwriters may receive compensation from the Issuer or from purchasers of debt securities for whom they may act as agents, in the
form of discounts, concessions or commissions. Underwriters may sell debt securities to or through dealers, and such dealers may receive compensation in the form of discounts, concessions or
commissions from the underwriters and/or commissions from the purchasers for whom they may act as agents. Underwriters, dealers and agents that participate in the distribution of debt securities may
be deemed to be underwriters, and any discounts or commissions received by them from the Issuer and any profit on the resale of debt securities by them may be deemed to be underwriting discounts and
commissions under the Securities Act. Any such compensation received from the Issuer will be described in the accompanying prospectus supplement. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Underwriters,

assurance can be given that any broker-dealer will make a market in the debt securities of any series or as to the liquidity of the trading market for such debt securities. </FONT></P>

transaction, SIS may resell a security it acquires from other holders, after the original offering and sale of the security. Resales of this kind may occur in the open market or may be privately
negotiated, at prevailing market prices at the time of resale or at related or negotiated prices. In these transactions, SIS may act as principal, or agent, including as agent for the counterparty in
a transaction in which SIS acts as principal, or as agent for both counterparties in a transaction in which SIS does not act as principal. SIS may receive compensation in the form of discounts and
commissions, including from both counterparties in some cases. Other of our affiliates may also engage in transactions of this kind and may use this prospectus for this purpose. </FONT></P>

issued. </FONT></P>

<P style="font-family:times;"><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
