DTC holds securities that its participating members, referred to as participants, deposit with DTC. DTC also facilitates the settlement among participants of securities transactions, such as transfers and\\npledges, in deposited securities through electronic computerized book-entry changes in participants\\x92 accounts, thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates. Direct participants of DTC include securities brokers\\nand dealers, banks, trust companies, clearing corporations, certain other organizations and may include the agents. DTC is a wholly-owned subsidiary of The Depository Trust\\xa0&amp; Clearing Corporation (\\x93DTCC\\x94). DTCC is the holding\\ncompany for DTC, National Securities Clearing Corporation and Fixed Income Clearing Corporation, all of which are registered clearing agencies. DTCC is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries. Access to DTC\\x92s system is also available\\nto others such as securities brokers and dealers, banks and trust companies, referred to as indirect participants, that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant, either directly or indirectly.

(\\x93Clearstream\\x94).\\nBeneficial owners of notes in book-entry form will not receive written confirmation from DTC of their purchase, but beneficial owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of the transaction, as well as periodic statements\\nof their holdings, from the direct participants or indirect participants through which the beneficial owner entered into the transaction. Transfers of ownership interests in a Global Note representing notes in book-entry form are to be accomplished\\nby entries made on the books of participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners. Beneficial owners of a Global Note representing notes in book-entry form will not receive notes in certificated form representing their ownership interests therein,\\nexcept in the event that use of the book-entry system for such notes is discontinued. </p>',\n",

The deposit of Global Notes with, or on behalf\\nof, the depositary and their registration in the name of Cede\\xa0&amp; Co. or another DTC nominee effect no change in beneficial ownership.

If the contingent\\npayment notes are listed on a national securities exchange or an interdealer quotation system sponsored by a national securities association, you generally would be permitted, but not required, to allocate such adjustment on a pro rata basis to the\\ndaily portions of accrued interest (as described above) over the remaining term of the contingent payment notes.
